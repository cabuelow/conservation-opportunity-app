### About

Conservation requires policy, regulatory and engagement mechanisms that enable effective action. We used 19 indicators of enabling mechanisms to group countries across the world into six **Enabling Profiles**.

Each **Enabling Profile** represents distinct enabling conditions for vegetated coastal wetland conservation (i.e., mangroves, seagrass and saltmarsh).

Use the [app](https://wetlands.app/enabling-profiles/) to explore **Enabling Profiles** and their policy, regulatory and engagement indicator status.
