1,1,Mangrove,"Monitor indirect effects of development on mangroves ->
Tailor policy/regulations to mitigate indirect effects -> decreased loss of mangroves to non-productive conversion",Herbicide run-off from crops caused mangrove dieback in Australia (Duke et al. 2005). Focussed regulation of herbicides could help to avoid future losses of mangroves due to the indirect effects of nearby agricultural production (King et al. 2013).,149.2071557,-21.14574458
2,1,Seagrass,Establish seagrass as an indicator of ecosystem health in catchment policy -> improved monitoring and management of catchment threats to seagrass -> reduced loss of seagrass to catchment processes,Seagrass was established as an indicator of ecosystem health in the EU Water Framework Directives leading to improved management and seagrass recovery (de los Santos  et al. 2019).,-1.45,43.2
3,2,Seagrass,Establish policy that prevents fish farms from being established near seagrass -> reduced loss of seagrass to anoxia associated with fish-farm pollution,"Following substantial seagrass loss, managers in Cyprus only allowed fish farms to operate in deep waters and seagrass expansion and recovery was documented (Kletou et al. 2018).",33.2,34.8
4,3,Mangrove,Establish national policy to protect mangroves from conversion to commodities and restore areas that have been converted -> incentivise community-lead restoration and sustainable management -> reduced loss of mangroves and livelihoods maintained,"The Indonesian government established policy to naturally rehabilitate mangroves via permeable dams, a ïBuilding with NatureÍ hybrid engineering approach to preventing erosion, while also fostering community involvement and ownership with assistance from an NGO (Winterwerp et al. 2020).",109.54,-6.8
5,3,Seagrass,NGOs raise awareness and lobby for management of catchment-based threats to seagrasses -> government establishes policy to manage catchment-based threats -> reduced seagrass loss,"An NGO has partnered with the Malaysian government to establish seagrass conservation projects in Malaysia, given the critical role of seagrass as habitat for dugongs (https://www.dugongconservation.org/where-we-work/malaysia/).",102.56,2.01
6,4,Mangrove,NGO and governmental support for establishing community-lead sustainable management of mangroves -> reduced mangrove loss of mangroves for timber harvesting and livelihoods maintained,"In Madagascar a small-scale crab fishery lead to increased harvesting of mangroves for timber, but community-lead management supported by NGOs and government actors resulted in reduced mangrove loss (Long et al. 2021).",45.14,-16.1
7,4,Seagrass,External support and funding secured to incentivise community-based management of fishing threats through payments for ecosystem services -> decreased loss and degradation of seagrass from fishing,"Support from an NGO and external funding established a payments for ecosystem services (PES) project in Kenya that enables carbon credits to be secured from seagrass, thereby providing an alternative source of income for local communities that depend on seagrass for fishing (via destructive practices; i.e., beach seining and trawling) (Shilland et al. 2021).",40.24,-2.72
8,5,Mangrove,"External NGO support for developing community-based sustainable management of mangrove forests with well-defined resource-use rights -> 
Government establishes policy that recognises communities as management authority ->
reduced mangrove clearing for fuel and timber","Mangroves in St. Lucia were historically cleared for charcoal production. Establishment of a common property institution that recognised resource rights of the local community and incentivised sustainable management resulted in reduced mangrove degradation (Smith and Berkes 1993). Subsequently, the St. Lucian government supported community-based management of mangroves by establishing policy that protected the mangroves but also formalised charcoal producers as the management authority.",-60.89,14
9,6,Mangrove,External NGO and industry actors provide support for installing permeable dams that trap sediment and provide space for mangrove regeneration and planting -> develop ecotourism as a livelihood that incentivises community involvement in mangrove conservation -> self-sustaining management of mangroves that reduces loss to erosion,"Erosion is a driver of loss in Suriname, and several external actors (industry and NGOs) installed permeable dams and initiated mangrove planting in Suriname to raise awareness and involve local communities in mangrove conservation (Winterwerp et al. 2019).",-55.81,5.94
10,6,Seagrass,External and state actors establish policy to raise awareness of the importance of seagrass -> build seagrass research and monitoring capacity -> inform catchment-based management plans -> reduced loss of seagrass from catchment-based threats,"In the Solomon Islands, logging is a major threat to seagrass (Brodie et al. 2020). To inform watershed management planning, the Solomon Islands government secured external support and funding to establish policy that aimed to raise awareness of the need for seagrass conservation and improve research and monitoring to enable better protection of seagrass as critical habitat for dugongs (WorldFish 2018).",159.98,-9.26
