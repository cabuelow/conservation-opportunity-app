### About

Conservation requires policy, regulatory and engagement mechanisms that enable effective action. We used 19 indicators of enabling mechanisms to group countries across the world into six **Enabling Profiles**.

Each **Enabling Profile** represents distinct conditions for vegetated coastal wetland conservation (i.e., mangroves, seagrass and saltmarsh).

Use the [app](https://cbuelow.shinyapps.io/conservation-opportunity/) to explore **Enabling Profiles** and their policy, regulatory and engagement indicator status.

Please cite Buelow et al. (*in prep*) *'Global opportunities for vegetated coastal wetland conservation'* in **People and Nature** if you use output from this app.
